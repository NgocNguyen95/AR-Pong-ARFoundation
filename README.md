# AR-Pong-ARFoundation
This project is an AR mobile game based on legacy Pong game. This contains only Assets, ProjectSettings and Packages folder so who clone this project will not get conflict either running on Window or Mac OS, and its light weight as well. This game can run well on iOS and Android devices. Development is going on so more features and bug fixes is coming. 

## About gameplay
This game is based on Pong game, player will controls the paddle to protect the goal and leads the ball to 3 enemy's goals. There is one power up will respawn random in game, who take it first can use it, which can freeze 1 enemy's paddle in 2 seconds. Any goal has 3 stars as 3 time hit, if any player on board lose 3 stars who will be knocked out. 

**Note!**
This created on Unity 2019.1.5f1, but 2019.2.0f has problems with Android SDK, so I recommend open this project with Unity 2019.1.5f1 above and Unity 2019.2.0 below.

**Note2!**
Most of my work is in folders starting with **MyOwn** and my real project is the scene **ARPongGame** in **MyOwnScenes** folder

## Packages requiment:

* AR Foundation 2.1.1
* ARCore XR Plugin 2.1.1

**Note!**
