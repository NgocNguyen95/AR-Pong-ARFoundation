# AR-Pong-ARFoundation
This project is an AR mobile game based on legacy Pong game. This contains only Assets, ProjectSettings and Packages folder so who clone this project will not get conflict either running on Window or Mac OS, and its light weight as well. This game can run well on iOS and Android devices. Development is going on so more features and bug fixes is coming. 

**Note!**
This created on Unity 2019.1.5f1, but 2019.2.0f has problems with Android SDK, so I recommend open this project with Unity 2019.1.5f1 above and Unity 2019.2.0 below.

## Packages requiment:

* AR Foundation 2.1.1
* ARCore XR Plugin 2.1.1
* ARKit XR Plugin 2.1.1

**Note!**
Do not download 2.2 version if you are not using iOS 13 and X code 11
